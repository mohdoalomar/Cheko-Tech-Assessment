# Assumptions
## 1- This is a single restaurant system only that doesn't support multiple restaurants
## 2- The backend is suppose to contain all bussiness from fetching locations, to search functionality.  
## 3- the figma design shows an "orders" card, but that seems out of the project scope, so it has been replaced with "others".
